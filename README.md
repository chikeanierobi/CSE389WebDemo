# CSE389WebDemo

Website to allow users to find books using Google Books API

Created login.jsp and registration.jsp to allow users gain access into the website.

Created RegistrationServlet.java used to handle requests and response sent between registration.jsp and the web server, in the process of doing the same for the login.jsp file
